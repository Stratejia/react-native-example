Thanks you for your interest in contributing to our repository.
Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

The [issue tracker](#TODO) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.  [TODO],
  [TODO] or [TODO] are better places to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
  Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.
