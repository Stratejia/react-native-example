# Golden rules

1. To Hell with the `class` keyword, only use functional programming.
2. Document everything. If unsure, ask a teammate! Knowledge is power.
3. Prefer `type` over `interface`.
4. Without over-engineering, isolate UI librairies and icons into the `src/components` folder.
5. Use `yarn`, never `npm`.
6. Always use a linter, in a way, it can act as unit testing in the context of a frontend app.
7. Domain logic shouldn't be placed in the frontend, nor should it be tested here.
8. A good CI is not a nice-to-have, it is a necessity.
